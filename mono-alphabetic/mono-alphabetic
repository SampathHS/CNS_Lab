1. Perform encryption and decryption using mono-alphabetic cipher.The program 
   should support the following:
i.  Construct an input file named plaintext.txt (consisting of 1000 alphabets,
	without any space or special characters)
ii. Compute key space (Permutation of set of all letters appeared in plaintext.txt:
	there are n! permutations of a set of n elements)
iii.Encrypt the characters of plaintext.txt using any one key from (ii)
	and store the corresponding ciphertext characters in ciphertext.txt
iv. Compute the frequency of occurrence of each alphabet in both plaintext.txt
	and ciphertext.txt and tabulate the results as follows
